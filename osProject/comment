The program comment can be shown in here because if we wirte comment in the code, if it not easy to copy code to the apollo to run

Also everything we need know can be written in here

The format as follow:



"int index = 0;"
index is the current child process index

“#define CHILD_NUMBER 13”
basically, we will have 13 child processes.
child 1~8 : Staff members
1.Alan
2.Billy
3.Cathy
4.David
5.Eva
6.Fanny
7.Gary
8.Helen

            9:  Team A & Project A
            10:  Team B & Project B
            11:  Team C & Project C
            12:  Team D & Project D
            13:  Team E & Project E



"int year(int yr);"
leap year: return 1

"int month(int yr, int mth)"
return the number of dates in a specific month

"int day(char *s1, char *s2)"
return the number of dates between s1 and s2
if the date is illegal, return -1


"char** split(char *str, char *delimiter);"
